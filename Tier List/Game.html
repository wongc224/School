            1. Legendary storyline that takes players on an emotional rollercoaster through the eyes of protagonist Kratos and his relationships with his son.
            2. Stunning visuals and sounds with immaculate details from fight scenes to sound effects that immerse the player in the story.
            I personally loved this game, the combat style, the story was perfect. The father sons slow build up of relation almost made me teared up.

          Elden Ring
          <span class="tooltip">
            1. Open-world exploration that allows players to control their experience and choose what they want to do, including collecting gear and challenging enemies.
            2. Engaging combat system with a variety of weapons, shields, and swords that offer endless possibilities and hours of gameplay.
            This game is fantastic, I played it during release. Grinding for weapons, testing out new armor and discovering new places. It feels like you can't get bored, the amount of classes there are really lets you immerse into the game itself.

        <div class="tierlist-header">A Tier</div>
        <div class="tierlist-cell" data-tooltip="Valorant">
          Valorant
          <span class="tooltip">
            I think Valorant is an A tier game because it is fun if you play it with friends, the characters are creative, it takes skills to play as it is a FPS (First Person Shooting) Game. The downsides are toxic people, they can really ruin your mood while you play the game. It also costs you a bit of sanity every time you play.

        <div class="tierlist-cell" data-tooltip="Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice">
          Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice
          <span class="tooltip">
            Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice has a really unique setting, it is set in Ancient Japan, it focuses on Japanese mythology and cultures. A challenging gameplay, it requires perfect timing and good strategies to defeat tough bosses, though this is also a downside, as players might find it overwhelming.

        <div class="tierlist-cell" data-tooltip="Halo">
          Halo
          <span class="tooltip">
            I put Halo as an A tier game because of the story line and the gameplay, the game does explore themes of identity and humanity, the gameplay is great, the animations and the combat works amazingly, but a downside is that the game might get increasingly boring, from my experience.
